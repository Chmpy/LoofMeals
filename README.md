# Loof Meals Repository

Greetings,

I extend a warm welcome to the Loof Meals repository.

Loof Meals stands as a testament to my skills and knowledge in Android application development, culminating in a proof of concept created during my final year at HoGent as part of my Android course.

The primary objective of Loof Meals is to cater to individuals with disabilities, encompassing various forms such as mobility and auditory impairments. The application aims to facilitate an effortless search for restaurants that adhere to accessibility standards set forth by the Belgian government.

It is important to note that the data provided by the government is frequently found to be incomplete or inaccurate, rendering this version as a proof of concept. My vision for the future is to enhance the user experience by incorporating comprehensive, self-hosted data, ultimately positioning Loof Meals as a project worthy of publication on mainstream app stores.

Thank you for exploring the Loof Meals repository.
